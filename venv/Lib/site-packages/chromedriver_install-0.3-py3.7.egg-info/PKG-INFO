Description: # Chromedriver installer  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/shadowmoose/chrome_driver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/shadowmoose/chrome_driver)
        
        This is a super-simple package that can automatically find & download the newest (or whichever you specify) version of 
        the chromedriver executable.
        
        It should work on Windows/Linx/Mac, and also supports os-specific permissions.
        
        To install the library, run:
        ```
        
        pip install chromedriver-install
        
        ```
        
        
        Then call it in your code like so:
        ```python
        
        import chromedriver_install as cdi
        path = cdi.install(file_directory='./lib/', verbose=True, chmod=True, overwrite=False, version=None)
        print('Installed chromedriver to path: %s' % path)
        
        ```
        
        There are options for the output directory, disabling printout, running chmod on the downloaded executable, 
        automatic overwriting, executable file name, and version number.
